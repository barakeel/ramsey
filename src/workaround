(* 
This is files contains a temporary workaround that allows us
to avoiding loading some theories in the theory graph.
We have created 1 million theories each of them containing one
gluing theorem. 
In HOL4, it is very slow to load one million theories 
in the theory graph, because the graph is represented as a list of pairs
(thy,parents) end not a dictionary.
When a new theory is loaded, it checks that its dependencies
are already in the graph leading to a worse than quadratic time complexity.
In the future, we will avoid this issue by creating about 5000 theories
each of them containing 200 gluing theorems instead.
